# Odin Recipes Website

## Project used to test my HTML knowledge

In this project I will practice my HTML knowledge by making a recipe website that contains some of the recipes that I like to cook

## The future of this project

In the future I will return to this project and implement new things as I learn, such as:

* CSS to make the website look better
* JavaScript to make the website more functional
* Database for the recipes using SQL
* Node.js to handle the backend

## Find a bug?

## Know issues (Work in progress)

This website is not yet completed, I'm still at the Foundations section of The Odin Project
