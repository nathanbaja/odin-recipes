    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) carton beef stock</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup white wine, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 shallot, chopped</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Place porcini mushrooms in a bowl and cover with hot water. Let soak until soft, about 1 hour. Drain, reserving soaking liquid. Squeeze mushrooms to remove excess water and roughly chop. </li>
        <li> Bring beef stock to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to low and cover to keep warm. </li>
        <li> Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic cloves; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, 5 to 6 minutes. Season with rosemary, salt, and pepper. Discard garlic cloves; pour in 1/2 cup wine. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer until wine reduces, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil with 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir shallot until soft, about 3 minutes. Cook and stir Arborio rice until toasted and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Pour in remaining 1/2 cup wine. Simmer until wine is absorbed, about 3 minutes. </li>
        <li> Ladle 1/3 of the warm stock into the saucepan; cook and stir until absorbed. Ladle in remaining stock and reserved soaking liquid in small amounts and cook, stirring constantly, until risotto is tender and creamy, 15 to 18 minutes. </li>
        <li> Remove risotto from the heat; stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and Parmesan cheese. Let stand for 3 to 5 minutes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
