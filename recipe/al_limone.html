    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 tablespoons (70 g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon, plus fresh juice to taste and additional grated zest for serving</li>
        <li>1 medium clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pound (450 g) fresh spaghetti, store-bought or homemade</li>
        <li>1 ounce (30 g) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat until foaming. Lower heat to low, add lemon zest and garlic, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. </li>
        <li> Meanwhile, in a medium pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until just shy of al dente. Reserve about 1 cup (240ml) of the starchy pasta water, then drain pasta. </li>
        <li> Add pasta to butter mixture, along with 1/2 cup (120ml) reserved pasta water. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring and tossing to coat, until pasta is glazed in a satiny, emulsified sauce.</li>
        <li> Add grated cheese and toss and stir rapidly until sauce thickens; if it becomes too tight and dry at any time, add more pasta-cooking water to loosen it sufficiently. Add lemon juice to taste, starting with 1 tablespoon (15ml), then adding more until desired tartness is reached. Season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li> Serve spaghetti right away, topping each serving with additional grated lemon zest and cheese. </li>
    </ol>
